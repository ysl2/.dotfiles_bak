    These are the keybindings added in this fork of htop:

        g        to the top (gg in vim)

      <C-b>      up 1 page

      <C-u>      up 1/2 page

        k

    h       l    one character

        j

      <C-d>      down 1/2 page

      <C-f>      down 1 page

        G        to the end

    --------------------------------------------------

        o        Expand/collapse (like in NERDTree)

    In order to accomodate these keybindings, the following changes were made to the original keybindings:

    - Ctrl+F and Ctrt+B can no longer be used to navigate horizontally
    - 'h' can no longer be used to access the help, leaving Ctrl+F1 & '?'
    - 'k' can no longer be used to kill processes, being replaced with 'x'
    - 'l' can no longer be used to list open files, being replaced with 'L'
    - 'x' can no longer be used to list file locks, being replaced with 'X'
